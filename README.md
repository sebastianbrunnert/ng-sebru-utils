# NgSebruLib

My personal library for standardized parts of Angular apps. If you want to, use it, but there is no documentation of the interface.

## Build

- `ng build ng-sebru-lib`
- `cd dist/ng-sebru-lib`
- `npm publish`

## Installation

- `npm install ng-sebru-lib`
- Include ng-sebru-lib css

Or simply use this repository as template. Pay attention to git initialization (multiple remote origins)
